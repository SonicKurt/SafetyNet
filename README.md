# SafetyNet

A website that has all of the information about on how to surf the web safely. It describes on how to use parental controls, security tips with your account and browser, rating system, and services. We made our website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also implemented a CSS grid that would allow us to use responsive web design for using a desktop or a mobile device.

This website was made for the 2020 RITE CoolTech Challenge competition.
